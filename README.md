# get_weather

**Quick, human-readable weather from the terminal (with some surprising side effects...)**

`get_weather` is a command-line tool that accepts a city name and returns a concise weather summary. It is designed for fast lookups with text-first output you can paste into notes, chats, or logs.

Examples:
```
./get_weather "San Francisco"
./get_weather "New York"
```
